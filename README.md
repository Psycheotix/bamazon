# A Node Product Store

Hello World, I just finished this simple node bamazon store.



Things the app does are:

1. Checks for products in the database
2. Makes a list of those products in the database
3. Asks the customer for which item to purchase
4. Asks the customer how many items of the selected item to purchase
5. Then it substracts the items purchased from the database

### Here is a sample video
